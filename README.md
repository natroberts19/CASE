# CAREER ADVISOR SOLUTION FOR EDUCATORS (CASE)

## Project Background and Description

### Application Description:
The Career Advisor Solution for Educators (CASE) application will be a full-stack, case management web application that will allow career advisors to create, update, and view student information and progress. The application is designed to be used by adult educators and career advisors. The application is scalable to be used in education and various social service organizations.

### Needs the Application Addresses:
Adult Learning Center Osceola (ALCO) serves adult students who are seeking assistance with learning English or finishing their high school diploma. While they are studying at ALCO, our Career Services department assists ALCO students with career planning and skills training. Currently, there are three advisors in Career Services that have individual caseloads of students that they assist with their career and education needs.

**Problems:**

1.	*Tracking and Updates.* Student registration and schedule data is tracked on a school-district system called FOCUS which is designed as a K-12 system. In FOCUS, there is no way to track career-related services or progress for adults. Right now we track advisee information using a system that is essentially a combination of an Excel spreadsheet and physical folders.

2.	*Reporting.* Part of an advisor's annual evaluation is based on a criterion known as Measurable Student Growth Outcome (MSGO). A successful MSGO is based on whether adult students that we advise advance in their education or career goals. A target percentage is established at the beginning of the evaluation period.

There are three categories of successful "exit" that qualify:
...1.	Test score attainment (GED or English level).
...2.	New job or promotion in current job.
...3.	Enrollment in post-secondary institution (college or voc-tech) or training program (ex. Career Source or Community Vision).
