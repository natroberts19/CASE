# Career Advisor Solution for Educators (CASE)

## Background

### Description
The Career Advisor Solution for Educators (CASE) application is a full-stack, case management web application that allows career advisors to create, update, and view student information and progress. The application is designed to be used by adult educators and career advisors. The application is scalable to be used in education and various social service organizations.

### Needs Addressed
Adult Learning Center Osceola (ALCO) serves adult students who are seeking assistance with learning English or finishing their high school diploma. While they are studying at ALCO, the Career Services department assists students with career planning and skills training. Currently, there are three advisors in Career Services that have individual caseloads of students that they assist with their career and education needs.

**Problems:**

1.	*Tracking and Updates.* Student registration and schedule data is tracked on a school-district system called FOCUS which is designed as a K-12 system. In FOCUS, there is no way to track career-related services or progress for adults. Right now, advisors track student information using a combination of an Excel spreadsheet and physical folders.

2.	*Reporting.* Part of an advisor's annual evaluation is based on a criterion known as Measurable Student Growth Outcome (MSGO). A successful MSGO is based on whether adult students that we advise advance in their education or career goals. A target percentage is established at the beginning of the evaluation period. Progress toward reaching this goal is tracked manually by each advisor.

**Solutions:**

The CASE application aims to solve these problems by...
